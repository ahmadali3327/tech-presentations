# Description

This was a Meetup presentation (https://www.meetup.com/AzureDublin/events/266072091/) where i had the opportunity to talk about how to leverage Azure Serverless to build applications using an Event-driven architecture.

When comes to build Cloud solutions, one important factor, most of the times, is the cost.
Azure provides services thinking on their clients worries and needs. This presentation is focused on explaining how you can leverage Azure Serverless and Event-driven applications to achieve these requirements.
With Serverless computing, the developer can easy deploy his code and do not need to worry about purchasing, provisioning and managing servers. Also, Serverless architectures offer greater scalability, more flexibility, and quicker time to release, all at a reduced cost.
With Event-driven architectures, we can build applications that use resources when it needs to act to a given event. So, it is built using event-driven communications and there is no pre-allocation of resources. In the context of Azure, this kind of architecture is based on Consumption pricing plans, so you only pay for what you consume in terms of Azure resources.
