# Description

This was a Meetup presentation (http://meetu.ps/e/GHY0S/tt37f/f) where i shared some of my experience, in past projects, working with Serverless Computing and Event-Driven Architecture. Given the time limitation for the presentation, i focused it in someo of the Azure Services that can be used to achieve it, such as Azure Functions, Azure Event Grid and Azure Logic App. At the end, a simple demo was presented to show in practice a real scenario of a Serverless Event-Driven Architecture.
